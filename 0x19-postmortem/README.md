Postmortem: Web Stack Outage
Issue Summary
Duration: June 1, 2024, 14:00 UTC - June 1, 2024, 16:30 UTC (2.5 hours)
Impact:
The main e-commerce website was down.
Users were unable to browse products or complete purchases.
Approximately 80% of users were affected.
Root Cause: A misconfiguration in the Nginx web server caused a conflict with the SSL certificate renewal process, leading to server crashes.
Timeline
14:00: Issue detected via monitoring alert indicating high error rates and server downtime.
14:05: Alert acknowledged by the on-call engineer.
14:10: Initial investigation began focusing on recent code deployments.
14:30: Rollback of recent deployments performed but did not resolve the issue.
15:00: Escalated to the network operations team.
15:15: Network team discovered Nginx errors related to SSL certificate.
15:30: Investigation into SSL certificate renewal process initiated.
16:00: Misconfiguration identified in the Nginx SSL setup.
16:15: Correct configuration applied to Nginx.
16:30: Nginx restarted, and services were restored. Monitoring confirmed normal operation.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause: The Nginx configuration file contained a conflicting SSL directive. During the automatic renewal of the SSL certificate, the configuration conflict caused Nginx to crash repeatedly.
Resolution: The conflicting directive was identified and corrected. The correct SSL configuration was applied, and Nginx was restarted. Additional checks were performed to ensure the SSL renewal process would not cause further issues.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements and Fixes:
Review and update Nginx configuration management practices.
Improve SSL certificate renewal process to include thorough pre-deployment checks.
Enhance monitoring to catch configuration issues earlier.
Task List:
Patch Nginx Configuration: Update the Nginx configuration to ensure no conflicting directives exist.
Automate SSL Testing: Implement automated tests for SSL configurations as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
Enhanced Monitoring: Add specific alerts for SSL configuration errors in the monitoring system.
Documentation Update: Update internal documentation to reflect best practices for SSL configurations and renewals.
Training: Conduct a training session for engineers on the correct Nginx SSL setup and common pitfalls.
By following these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to prevent similar outages in the future and improve overall system resilience.
